My first contact with coding was all the way back in 2005, when I learned that websites are made with HTML. 
On year later, I got in touch with my first programming language, PHP.  
But I really learned programming from a book called [*C for Dummies* by Dan Gookin](https://www.amazon.com/C-Dummies-Dan-Gookin/dp/0764570684) which shaped the way I think about coding.

Over the years, I played with countless programming and coding languages, from the high levels of JavaScript and HTML, to the low depths of C++, C, even freaking Assembly.   
For the most part, I try to follow community guidelines when it comes to how my code looks, but there are edge cases where I feel like those guidelines aren't making sense, or different people have conflicting ideas on the same topic.

On this website, I will try to write down my own
