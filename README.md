# Cornel's Style Guide

Hi there, 

This is a Cornel, and I'm a programmer. I've been a programmer for about half my life.  
In time, I developed some opinions on how code should be written. 
Opinions which may or may not match established "Style Guides", or may add to them. 

Since you're here, I suggest starting with [index.markdown](index.markdown), 
then check the various guides I posted in the [guides](guides) folder.

If you an easier interface, check out [My Style Guide](https://vladutcornel.github.io/style-guide/), 
generated with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
